# ReactJS + Firebase

## React
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Firebase
All firebase configs are in `src/constants/config.js`.

To initialize firebase - you need to have a `firebase-tools` (https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#macos).
We are using both firebase and surge.sh hosting.
